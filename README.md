A search engine that both scrapes data and displays the most recent database of data at the same time.

Limited to 20GB database as I'm running it using Google cloud for free (30 GB disk space) at SEDER.dev.

Originally, I made this to read from a CSV file but I realise now that that was pretty stupid.

I used help from chatGPT in the end to convert it from CSV to SQL.

If you have any suggestions let me know.
